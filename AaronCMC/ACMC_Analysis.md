3. **Cultural Attitudes**: Stigma surrounding mental health can affect reporting and help-seeking behavior.

4. **Education**: Higher education levels often correlate with better awareness and understanding of mental health issues.

5. **Political Stability**: Countries experiencing conflict or political turmoil tend to have higher rates of mental health disorders.

6. **Substance Abuse**: Higher prevalence of alcohol and drug use can lead to increased mental health issues.

7. **Social Support Systems**: Strong community ties and support networks can mitigate mental health issues.
