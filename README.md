## Drug Use Disorder Rates  
* Explored the topic of drug use disorder rates, emphasizing the importance of addressing these disorders for individual health and societal well-being. A time series analysis from 2010 to 2017 highlighted the top five countries with significant trends, revealing a concerning 16% increase in the United States, alongside varying changes in other nations. Additionally, we examined drug use disorder rates in relation to government support types—monetary (e.g., disability payments, Medicaid expansion) and non-monetary (e.g., housing assistance, employment services)—and noted that both forms of support expanded during this period. This expansion coincided with rising drug use disorder rates, particularly in the U.S., suggesting a complex relationship between government benefits and substance use disorders. Finally, we acknowledged limitations in the analysis, including reliance on 2014 data for government benefits and the need for more detailed categorization to enhance future research.
