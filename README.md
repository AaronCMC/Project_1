# Mental Disorder Rate Dataset.  

## Drug Use Disorder Rates  
* Explored the topic of drug use disorder rates, emphasizing the importance of addressing these disorders for individual health and societal well-being. A time series analysis from 2010 to 2017 highlighted the top five countries with significant trends, revealing a concerning 16% increase in the United States, alongside varying changes in other nations. Additionally, we examined drug use disorder rates in relation to government support types—monetary (e.g., disability payments, Medicaid expansion) and non-monetary (e.g., housing assistance, employment services)—and noted that both forms of support expanded during this period. This expansion coincided with rising drug use disorder rates, particularly in the U.S., suggesting a complex relationship between government benefits and substance use disorders. Finally, we acknowledged limitations in the analysis, including reliance on 2014 data for government benefits and the need for more detailed categorization to enhance future research.  

# Demographic and Temporal Factors Influence on the Prevalence of Mental Health Disoders 
How do demographic factors (such as geographic region, family history, and employment status) and temporal trends (from 2010 to 2017) influence the prevalence and patterns of mental health conditions, including schizophrenia, mood disorders, and drug use disorders?”
The above was determined via a number of datasets and ultimately, analyzed to show that there were increases and decreases in mental health conditions such as schizophrenia in particular. Factors such as location/region, family history, employment status, drug use disorders and mood disorders were all analyzed to conclude that there is in fact a relationship between demographic and temporal factors and mental health challenges.Various percentages and rates can be seen in the coding for more of an indepth analysis.
