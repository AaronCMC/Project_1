Project Overview- In this project we have aimed to analyze the relationship between various mental health disorders and suicide rates across different countries from 2010 to 2017
Manroop Kaur Question- How does the prevalence of mental disorders correlate with suicide rates across different countries?

Mental Health and Suicide Rates Analysis (2010-2017)
The primary goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding how mental health issues impact suicide rates globally.

Datasets Used
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder
This dataset includes mental health disorders and related factors across various countries.

This dataset contains information on the prevalence of various mental health disorders.

Columns of interest: Entity, Year, Schizophrenia (%), Bipolar disorder (%), Eating disorders (%), Anxiety disorders (%), Drug use disorders (%), Depression (%), Alcohol use disorders (%),
Suicide rate (deaths per 100,000 individuals), Depressive disorder rates (number suffering per 100,000).
Data Collection: Collected datasets from Kaggle and other reliable sources.

Merged datasets on Country/Entity and Year to create a comprehensive view.
Data Cleaning: Filtered data for the years 2010-2017.
Removed unnecessary columns and ensured no duplicate data entries.

Data Analysis:
Analyzed the top 10 and bottom 10 countries in terms of suicide rates.
Explored correlations between different mental health disorders and suicide rates.
Used statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to gain deeper insights.

Visualization:Created scatter plots, linear regression graphs, and other visualizations to highlight key findings.
Compared mental health disorder rates with suicide rates across selected countries.
Key Findings-Correlation between Mental Health Disorders and Suicide Rates:Weak positive correlations were observed between certain mental health disorders 
(e.g., depression, anxiety) and suicide rates in many countries.
Country-Specific Insights:Some countries with high suicide rates also had high prevalence rates of certain mental health disorders, suggesting a potential link.
Temporal Trends:
Over the years 2010-2017, the data showed consistent patterns in mental health disorders and their possible influence on suicide rates.

Tools and Technologies-Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: To handle and manipulate datasets.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
