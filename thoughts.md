Higher mental disorder rates in a country can correlate with several factors, including:

1. **Socioeconomic Status**: Poverty, unemployment, and income inequality can increase stress and reduce access to mental health care.

2. **Healthcare Access**: Availability and quality of mental health services influence diagnosis and treatment rates.

3. **Cultural Attitudes**: Stigma surrounding mental health can affect reporting and help-seeking behavior.

4. **Education**: Higher education levels often correlate with better awareness and understanding of mental health issues.

5. **Political Stability**: Countries experiencing conflict or political turmoil tend to have higher rates of mental health disorders.

6. **Substance Abuse**: Higher prevalence of alcohol and drug use can lead to increased mental health issues.

7. **Social Support Systems**: Strong community ties and support networks can mitigate mental health issues.

8. **Urbanization**: Rapid urbanization can lead to stressors related to housing, employment, and social isolation.

9. **Trauma Exposure**: Higher rates of trauma (e.g., violence, natural disasters) can lead to increased mental health disorders.

10. **Genetic and Biological Factors**: Certain populations may have genetic predispositions to mental health disorders.

Each country may experience a unique combination of these factors, influencing its overall mental health landscape.
